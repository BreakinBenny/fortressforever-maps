You'll need to extract some CS:S, DoD:S, and HL2DM content in-order to get everything to show up.

Check the bspzip txt file to see which files exactly.

IMPORTANT:  DON'T EXTRACT THAT SHIT TO YOUR NORMAL FortressForever DIRECTORY!

We've been using a separate FF directory named ff_boner that has all the extra content.

That way you keep a clean copy of FF as well as this other ff_boner copy that's filled with extra content to use.

Skadaaaap!
